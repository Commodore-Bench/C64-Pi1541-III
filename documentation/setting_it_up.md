# 1> Setting it up
This part of the documentation takes care of setting up your Pi1541-III, taking care of everything needed to enjoy using it after the hardware has previously been [assembled](https://github.com/tebl/C64-Pi1541-III/blob/main/documentation/assembling_one.md). While most of this information would be relevant to any build of a pi1541, this guide will cover the relevant differences for the Pi1541-III in particular - type of display, use of rotary encoder, that kind of *thing*.
