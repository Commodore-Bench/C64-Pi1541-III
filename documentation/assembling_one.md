# 1> Assembling one
Assembling a Pi1541-III from scratch can seem a bit intimidating at first, or not intimidating enough depending on how you look at it. There are quite a lot of things that need to be put together in ways that don't have a huge tolerance for error, that's not to say that it is hard - all that's required is simply to take your time with it. It's more akin to a 3d-puzzle than a standard flat piece of PCB.
